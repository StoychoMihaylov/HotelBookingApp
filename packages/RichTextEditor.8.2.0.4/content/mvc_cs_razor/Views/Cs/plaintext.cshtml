            This sample demonstrates retrieving the RichTextEditor HTML content in the plain
            text format. If you want to store the document text in a database which is searchable,
            you can use the output of this property to create an HTML-free copy for indexing.

                                When your algorithmic and programming skills have reached a level which you cannot
                                improve any further, refining your team strategy will give you that extra edge you
                                need to reach the top. We practiced programming contests with different team members
                                and strategies for many years, and saw a lot of other teams do so too.

                            <p>
                                From this we developed a theory about how an optimal team should behave during a
                                contest. However, a refined strategy is not a must: The World Champions of 1995,
                                Freiburg University, were a rookie team, and the winners of the 1994 Northwestern
                                European Contest, Warsaw University, met only two weeks before that contest.
